    ✓ Implement progress monitoring via SSE without starting new analysis
    ✓ Add ProgressState database model for persistence
    ✓ Update frontend logic to distinguish between monitoring vs starting analysis
    ✓ Implement proper cleanup of completed/expired progress states

12. Progress Indicator for Analysis Refresh
    ✓ Add Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint for progress updates
    ✓ Modify processSymbols to report progress
    ✓ Update frontend to show progress bar during refresh
    ✓ Show current symbol being processed
